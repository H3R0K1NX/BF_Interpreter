## Brainfuck interpreter made with C++

### Background story 
Got really bored, decided to practice some C++, and that's the first thing that came out of it.

### Usage
Compile using GCC or VS the *"Main.c"* file.
Run the interpreter in that format:
```bash
~ ./Main HelloWorld.bf
```
Where *"HelloWorld.bf"* is the file you want interpret.
